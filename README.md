Python program simulating the game Monopoly Deal by Hasbro and sold by Cartamundi.

**Modifications from original game:**

* All properties are worth the same amount of cash.
* Properties of the same color are equal (i.e. no names for properties).
* Priority for rent goes money first, then property.
* Giving up 1 property ends the rent.
