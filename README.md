Python program simulating the game _Monopoly Deal_ by Hasbro and sold by Cartamundi.

# Modifications from original game:

* All properties are worth the same amount of cash.
* Properties of the same color are equal (i.e. no names for properties).
* Priority for rent goes money first, then property.
* Giving up 1 property ends the rent.
* Wild cards are treated as normal properties as soon as they are played (i.e. tapping WCs not possible).

# How to Download and Play:

1. Download `nmd.py`.
2. Run the command
```bash
python3 [-i] nmd.py
```
in your terminal. The `-i` flag can be used for testing.

3. Enjoy!
